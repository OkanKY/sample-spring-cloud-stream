# sample-spring-cloud-stream

Let me start with a few words on the theoretical aspects of the Spring cloud stream. The Spring Cloud Stream Reference Guide provides a short reference to that framework. Itâ€™s based on Spring integration. It provides three predefined interfaces out of the box:

Source: Can be used for an application which has a single outbound channel.
Sink: Can be used for an application which has a single inbound channel.
Processor: Can be used for an application which has both an inbound channel and an outbound channel.
